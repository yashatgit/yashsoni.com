## Package Manager

Projects have a lot in common in terms of components and logic so it might be an better idea to abstract functionalities into reusable libraries, so that they may be shared across projects.
It can be difficult to manage these libraries (or dependencies, as theyâ€™re commonly called) manually. This is where a package manager comes in. Package managers automate the process of installing, upgrading, configuring and removing packages (or dependencies or libraries) in your project.
