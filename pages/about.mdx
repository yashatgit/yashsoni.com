### Hello Again!

I purchased this domain back in 2008 when I didn't even know how to build websites or even write code for that matter.

Over the years, this website has taken different shapes. If you have some extra time at hand, you can check the versions from [2010](https://yashsoni.netlify.app/nostalgia/v1/index.html), [2012](https://yashsoni.netlify.app/nostalgia/v2/index.html), [2015](https://yashsoni.netlify.app/nostalgia/v3/index.html), and [2018](https://yashsoni.netlify.app).

In the initial years, I was focussing more on showcasing what I have built and designed - a portfolio approach.
With this latest version (v5), I have realized that there is still a lot to learn about technology and life in general - and this is an attempt to share that in form of a personal blog.

Writing has always been my biggest fear. Sometimes I marvel at how people are able to express their feeling through words. With this blog, my focus is to develop this skill and [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/).

And if you have read this far, here is a short version of a clichéd about page.

I love learning and building things. You can find some of the projects on my [Github](https://github.com/yashatgit).
I like (liked?) [paintings](https://yashsoni.netlify.app/nostalgia/v2/portfolio_design.html) and occasional [photography](http://yashsoni.com/photography).
