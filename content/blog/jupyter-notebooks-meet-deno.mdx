I am a huge fan of using Jupyter Notebooks because it allow a beautiful blend of code execution, 
visualization, and documentation in a single environment.

Only issue was it was not available for Javascript runtime...

So few days back I stumbled upon this tweet and the [announcement](https://deno.com/blog/v1.37#jupyter-notebook-integration)
<StaticTweet id="1704495791698575365"/>

Setting it up was surprisingly easy, as long as the Python environment is [correctly setup](https://xkcd.com/1987/)!
```bash
pip install jupyterlab

deno jupyter --unstable
```

Once launched, you are prompted with the kernel to use:

/>

Now, JavaScript runtime in the form of the Deno kernel is available for all the JavaScript magic âœ¨.
