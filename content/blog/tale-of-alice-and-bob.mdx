**Alice** and **Bob** are fictional characters commonly used as a placeholder name in cryptology.

Alice and Bob first appeared in 1978 in a [paper on cryptography](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/359340.359342). _A method for obtaining digital signatures and public-key cryptosystems_. They wrote

> "For our scenarios we suppose that A and B (also known as Alice and Bob) are two users of a public-key cryptosystem".

Instead of saying "How can B send a private message M to A in a public-key cryptosystem?", they chose to represent it with more human friendly names Alice and Bob.

Within a few years, reference to Alice and Bob in cryptological literature became failry common and it even started to appear in Science and Engineering.

## Cast of characters

The [world of Alice and Bob](http://cryptocouple.com/) grew with time and now there is a complete cast of characters serving some generic purpose.

| **character name** | **usage** &nbsp; &nbsp;                                                                                                          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Alice and Bob      | The original, generic characters. Generally, Alice and Bob want to exchange a message or cryptographic key.                      |
| Carol              | The generic third participant.                                                                                                   |
| Eve                | The eavesdropper, who is usually a passive attacker                                                                              |

| Mallory            | Malicious attacker. Unlike the passive Eve, Mallory/Mallet is an active attacker. usually participating in man-in-middle attacks |
| Trent              | A trusted arbitrator, who acts as a neutral third party                                                                          |
