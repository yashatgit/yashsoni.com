The [Open Graph protocol](https://ogp.me/), developed by Facebook, enhances web pages by enabling them to become rich objects within a social graph or, 
more simply, across various social media platforms. 
This enhancement is achieved by adding descriptive tags and images to the content, which appear as a link preview without the need for users to visit the actual page.

At its core, this functionality is controlled by incorporating `meta` tags into the web page.

<Table
  data={{
    headers: [
      'meta tag name',
      'description'
    ],
    rows: [
        ['og:title', 'The title of your object as it should appear within the graph, e.g.'],      
        ['og:description', 'A one to two sentence description of your object.'],
        ['og:type', 'The type of your object, e.g., "video.movie". Depending on the type you specify, other properties may also be required.'],
        ['og:image' ,'An image URL which should represent your object within the graph.'],
        ['og:url', 'The canonical URL of your object that will be used as its permanent ID in the graph.'],
    ],
  }}
/>

For example, a link to this page would display differently across various social networks as follows: 
<MediaGrid
  photos={[
    {
      src: '/static/media/open-graph-protocol-and-generating-dynamic-OG-images/og-fb-twitter.jpeg',
      width: 900,
      height: 1097
    },
    {
      src: '/static/media/open-graph-protocol-and-generating-dynamic-OG-images/og-linkedin-discord.jpeg',
      width: 900,
      height: 1370
    }
  ]}  
/>

This is achieved by inserting the following tags into the page: 

```html
<meta property="og:title" content="Open Graph protocol and generating Dynamic OG images in Next.Js">
<meta property="og:description" content="Discover how to create dynamic, automatically updating Open Graph images in Next.js for visually rich link previews">
<meta property="og:url" content="https://yashsoni.com/blog/open-graph-protocol-and-generating-dynamic-OG-images">
<meta property="og:image" content="https://yashsoni.com/og?title=Open Graph protocol and generating dynamic OG images">
<meta property="og:type" content="article">
```

## Generating Dynamic Open Graph Images in Next.js

For this site, my requirements for the Open Graph image were straightforward: a standard background with dynamic text for each web page.

- Design an HTML and CSS layout featuring a background image and dynamic text.
- Convert this layout into an image using the npm package [Satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori).
- Expose this as a [Vercel Edge Function](https://vercel.com/docs/functions), allowing these images to be dynamically created at build time or runtime using `@vercel/og`.

The [entire code](https://github.com/yashatgit/yashsoni.com/blob/master/app/og/route.tsx) looks like this:
```TSX
// filename: app/og/route.tsx

export async function GET(req: NextRequest) {
  const { searchParams } = req.nextUrl;
  const postTitle = searchParams.get("title");
  
  return new ImageResponse(
    (
      <div
        style={{
          height: "100%",
          width: "100%",
          display: "flex",
          flexDirection: "column",
          alignItems: "flex-start",
          justifyContent: "center",
          backgroundImage: "url(https://yashsoni.com/og-bg-author.jpeg)",
        }}
      >
        <div
          style={{
            color: "white",            
          }}
        >
          {postTitle}
        </div>
      </div>
    ),
    {
      width: 1920,
      height: 1080,
    }
  );
}
```

This exposes a nifty Route on `https://yashsoni.com/og?title=${title}` which can generate Dynamic Images.

This route then can be fed into the blog page to generate the OG images.

```tsx
// filename app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
export async function generateMetadata({ params }) {
  let { title, description} = post.metadata;
  let ogImage = `https://yashsoni.com/og?title=${title}`;

  return {
    title,
    description,
    openGraph: {
      title,
      description,
      type: "article",
      url: `https://yashsoni.com/blog/${post.slug}`,
      images: [
        {
          url: ogImage,
        },
      ],
    },
    twitter: {
      card: "summary_large_image",
      title,
      description,
      images: [ogImage],
    },
  };
}
```
