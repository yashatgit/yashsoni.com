[![XKCD](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/server_problem.png)](https://xkcd.com/1084/)

So you have spent a good time building your node application in the dev environment. Transferring the application from dev to prod environment is a different ball game altogether.
When the app runs in a cloud server hosted in a remote location, the ease of debugging, logging and mannaging the app which comes while developing locally, is lost.

`PM2` or `Process Manager 2` is an incredibly versatile production-level process manager for NodeJs apps. It provides the following benefits out of the box:

- **Restart after Crashes**: Restart your apps after it crashes due to any reason.
- **Alive forever**: You can make your apps auto-start at system boot. Thus allowing for **High Availability (HA)** configurations.
- **Real time Monitoring**: Provides real good developer experience to manage and monitor the running processes.
- **Load balancing and clustering**: PM2 has a built in Load Balancer and even allows you to run your apps in **cluster mode**.

## Getting started

First thing we need to do is to install PM2 globally on the machine.

```bash
npm i -g pm2
```

Next, to start a process, `pm2 start <script> --name <name for running process>`

```bash
pm2 start app.js --name app                # equivalent to node app.js
pm2 start npm -- run start:prod            # equivalent to npm run start:prod

[PM2] Starting /usr/bin/npm in fork_mode (1 instance)
[PM2] Done.

┌──────────┬────┬──────┬──────┬───────┬────────┬─────────┬─────┐
│ App name │ id │ mode │ pid  │ status│ restart│ uptime  │ cpu │
├──────────┼────┼──────┼──────┼───────┼────────┼─────────┼─────┤
│ app      │ 0  │ fork │ 807  │ online│ 0      │ 0m      │ 0%  │
└──────────┴────┴──────┴──────┴───────┴────────┴─────────┴─────┘
 Use `pm2 show <id|name>` to get more details about an app
```

With this, your app is now running under PM2, and if it crashes, PM2 will restart it.

To enable **persistance through restarts** i.e to ensure it starts again when rebooting the system, you can execute `pm2 save` to save the current configuration.

```bash
pm2 save
[PM2] Saving current process list...
[PM2] Successfully saved in C:\Users\moose\.pm2\dump.pm2
```

Now, whenever the system restarts, PM2 will start whatever processes we had running when we last ran `pm2 save`.

## Managing processes

To list the status of all application managed by PM2, run `pm2 [list|ls|status]`

```bash
pm2 ls

┌──────────┬────┬─────────┬──────┬─────┬────────┬─────────┬────────┬──────┬───────────┬──────┬──────────┐
│ App name │ id │ version │ mode │ pid │ status │ restart │ uptime │ cpu  │ mem       │ user │ watching │
├──────────┼────┼─────────┼──────┼─────┼────────┼─────────┼────────┼──────┼───────────┼──────┼──────────┤
│ mm       │ 0  │ N/A     │ fork │ 807 │ online │ 0       │ 49m    │ 0%   │ 1.2 MB    │ pi   │ disabled │
│ vision   │ 1  │ N/A     │ fork │ 809 │ online │ 0       │ 49m    │ 0.9% │ 20.8 MB   │ pi   │ disabled │
└──────────┴────┴─────────┴──────┴─────┴────────┴─────────┴────────┴──────┴───────────┴──────┴──────────┘
 Use `pm2 show <id|name>` to get more details about an app
```

The following is a list of some common process (single or all) management commands you should take note of:

```bash
pm2 restart app_name          #restart app with name app_name
pm2 restart all               #restart all apps

pm2 stop app_name             #stop app with name app_name
pm2 stop all                  #stop all apps

pm2 delete app_name           #kill and delete app with name app_name
pm2 delete 1                  #kill and delete app with ID 1
pm2 delete all                #kill and remove all apps

pm2 save                      #save current process list on reboot
pm2 startup                   #enable PM2 to start at system boot
pm2 unstartup                 #disable PM2 from starting at system boot
```

For logging

```bash
pm2 logs                      #view logs for all processes
pm2 logs 1	         	      #view logs for app 1
```

## Monitoring

PM2 has a provision of a realtime dashboard that fits directly into the terminal:

```bash
pm2 monit
```
