Since we first started diving, there’s always been one destination that seemed to come up in every conversation about dream dive spots - **Raja Ampat**.

Tucked away in the northwestern corner of Indonesia’s West Papua province, Raja Ampat sits at the junction where the Indian Ocean meets the Pacific.

Its remote location makes it a paradise for marine life and a coveted spot for divers worldwide. 
Because of this it it famously regarded as the **most marine biodiverse region on the planet**.

When we saw that [Outbound Scuba](https://www.instagram.com/outboundscuba/) was organizing a dive trip to Raja Ampat, we knew it was time to seize the opportunity.


## The Journey to Raja Ampat
Getting to Raja Ampat turned out to be quite an adventure in itself. 
Usually, when we go on dive trips, we just hop on a plane, then take a quick taxi or boat ride to where we're staying. 
But this time, it was a whole different story!

We had no idea it would be one of the hardest places we've ever tried to reach. 
With each flight we took, we felt like we were going further and further off the beaten path. 
As we went, the planes kept getting smaller and smaller, but our excitement just kept growing.

The route was nothing short of epic: 

**Dubai -> Singapore -> Bali -> Surabaya -> Makassar -> Sorong -> Boat Transfer -> Dive resort**.

When we finally arrived, we got such a warm welcome! 
The locals greeted us with traditional Papuan dancing and music. 
It was a perfect start to our adventure in this amazing, far-off place.

## Life at dive resort and the House Reef:
Our home base for the trip was [Papua Explorers](https://www.papuaexplorers.com/), a dive resort nestled at the foothills of a mountain canopy.
Picture cozy water bungalows sitting right on the ocean, blending in with the beautiful surroundings.

Every detail of the resort was thoughtfully crafted, from the locally sourced meals to the eco-friendly amenities.
The food at the resort was a pleasant surprise. Everything we ate was sourced locally, and it's hard to put into words just how tasty a simple plate of rice and lentils could be. 

What stood out even more was the attention to *sustainability* and protecting the ocean. 
Since all the water from the resort flows into the sea, they made sure to use only eco-friendly soaps and shampoos without harsh chemicals. 
It was fascinating to watch as the bathroom outlets fed directly into the waters beneath our bungalow, where small fish darted through the soap bubbles. 
It felt like we were living in harmony with the ocean, not just beside it.


#### House Reef
The care and effort put into preserving the local environment really showed in the health of the house reef. 
It was in fantastic shape, a vibrant underwater garden right on our doorstep.

## Biodiversity: A ‘Species Factory’
Raja Ampat is often referred to as a 'species factory'. The sheer variety of marine life here is staggering. 
Hard and soft corals fight for space on reefs that are alive with color, while schools of fish swirl around in a dazzling display of biodiversity.

Here's a video which translates the above words into reality.

## Coral Gardens
The coral gardens are unlike anything we've seen before. 
Imagine a lush hillside garden full of vibrant flowers and busy insects, but flipped upside down and submerged in water. That's what Raja looks like underwater.
In this underwater garden, the fish become the birds and insects, and the corals take the place of flowers, swaying gently with the ocean currents. 

It's estimated that Raja Ampat contains more than 600 species of hard coral - 75% of the total for the entire world!

## Dive Itinerary
Over the course of 6 days, we completed 18 dives on Nitrox. Max depth we reached was 29m at South Kri while averaging 20m overall.

And perhaps the most memorable part of this trip? We achieved a major milestone: **our 50th dive!** 
Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine I'd reach this point. Every dive was a celebration of how far we've come in our diving journey, and there was no better place to mark this achievement than in the heart of Raja Ampat.
