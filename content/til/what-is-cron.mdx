Automation, while often met with fear, is an important goal of software development and technology in general.
There are times when there’s a need for running a group of tasks automatically at certain predefined times in the future.
And lets face it, no one likes to do repetitive jobs. This is where **Cron** comes into picture.

**Cron** is a **time-based** job scheduler in Unix-like systems, used to run commands or scripts at specific intervals (times, dates, etc.).

The most used version of Cron is _Vixie Cron_ which was developed by [Paul Vixie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Vixie) in 1987. The word originates from the Greek word _χρόνος_ (chronos), which means time.

## Crontabs & Cron jobs

Cron uses special configuration files called **crontab** files, which lists a _tabular_ list of commands or _jobs_ to run.

Crontab stands for **cron table** and each line in the crontab file is called a **cron job**.

To list the configured crontab file, run the following command

```bash
crontab -l
```

If you don’t have any cron jobs currently configured, you should see a message, saying `no crontab for <user>`.

## Anatomy of a Crontab Entry

The anatomy of a user-level crontab entry looks like the following:

```bash
# ┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
# │ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
# │ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)
# │ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)
# │ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 6) (Sunday to Saturday;
# │ │ │ │ │                                   7 is also Sunday on some systems)
# │ │ │ │ │
# │ │ │ │ │
# * * * * * <command to execute>
```

The 5 astrieks **\*** represent the time to execute the command.

Suppose you want to schedule a job every which takes a backup every 30 minutes. The corresponding conjob would be something like this:

```bash
*/30 * * * * /var/www/sites/db_backup.sh
```

Memorising the exact syntax can be difficult so you can visit the following sites to build a custom cron schedule expression.
